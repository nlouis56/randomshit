# teamsPrankingScript

## Description

This python script will move your mouse and randomly change active windows. It's useful to appear active on Microsoft Teams and other similar platforms.

## Requirements

The program uses pyautogui for the mouse and keyboard control. You can install it with pip.

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

## Usage

Just run the script and it will start moving the mouse and changing windows. You can stop it by pressing Ctrl+C or quickly moving the mouse to the top left corner of the screen during a random mouse movement.

```bash
python teamsPrankingScript.py
```

The script will not click or type anything, it just does Alt+Tab and moves the mouse.
